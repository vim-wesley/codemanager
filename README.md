I been thinking if a tool like this existed. I haven't found one yet.

**THIS TOOL IS NOT SAFE. IT SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR TESTS IN A PROPER ENVIRONMENT**

## Installation
clone this repo to somewhere.

``git clone https://github.com/vim-wesley/codemanager $HOME/.config/codemanager``

in bashrc
```bash
. $HOME/.config/codemanager/config.sh
```
